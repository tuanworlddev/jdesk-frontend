Build an OS-native installer from your packaged app image and understand what signing
requires. This guide continues from [Package your app](/docs/packaging): you should
already have a working `jdeskPackage` app image before building an installer.

## Build a native installer

```bash
./gradlew jdeskInstaller
```

`jdeskInstaller` runs `jpackage` on the `jdeskPackage` app image to build the OS's native
installer into `build/jdesk/installer`. It runs **on the target OS only** — the same
cross-packaging rule as `jdeskPackage`.

The installer type defaults to the OS default; override it with `-PjdeskInstallerType`:

| OS | Formats | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `dmg`, `pkg` | `./gradlew jdeskInstaller -PjdeskInstallerType=pkg` |
| Windows | `msi`, `exe` | `./gradlew jdeskInstaller -PjdeskInstallerType=msi` |
| Linux | `deb`, `rpm` | `./gradlew jdeskInstaller -PjdeskInstallerType=deb` |

The macOS DMG path is verified end-to-end locally (a real 34 MB DMG); Windows MSI and Linux
DEB are built in the CI package jobs. See
packaging and signing for the current
per-platform status.

## Installers are UNSIGNED without an identity

`jdeskInstaller` produces a **real but UNSIGNED** installer unless a signing identity is
configured for the current OS. Unsigned packages are fine for development and internal
verification, but they are labeled `UNSIGNED` and **do not satisfy a signed-release gate**.
Signing itself is delegated to the OS toolchains (`signtool`, `codesign` + `notarytool`,
`dpkg-sig`/`rpmsign`); the plugin only invokes them from the values you set.

## Configure the signing hooks

The signing surface is the `jdesk { signing { } }` block. Set the identities for the
platforms you distribute:

```kotlin
jdesk {
    signing {
        // Windows — Authenticode
        windowsCertificate.set("<certificate subject or thumbprint>")
        windowsTimestampUrl.set("http://timestamp.example/rfc3161")

        // macOS — Developer ID + notarization
        macSigningIdentity.set("Developer ID Application: Acme Inc (TEAMID)")
        macNotarizationProfile.set("<notarytool keychain profile name>")

        // Linux — package signing
        linuxSigningKey.set("<GPG key id>")
    }
}
```

| Property | Toolchain | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `windowsCertificate` | `signtool` | Authenticode identity (certificate subject or thumbprint). |
| `windowsTimestampUrl` | `signtool` | RFC 3161 timestamp URL. |
| `macSigningIdentity` | `codesign` | Developer ID Application identity. |
| `macNotarizationProfile` | `notarytool` | Notarization keychain profile (`--keychain-profile`). |
| `linuxSigningKey` | `dpkg-sig` / `rpmsign` | GPG package-signing key id. |

When at least one identity is set for the current OS, the installer step signs using it;
otherwise the artifact is `UNSIGNED`.

## A signed pipeline needs your credentials

The signing hooks are a **configuration surface**, not a turnkey signed pipeline. A fully
wired, signed-and-notarized end-to-end release is Phase-7 work and is **not yet
demonstrated**. It also requires credentials that only you can supply and that are never
checked in:

- **Windows** — an Authenticode code-signing certificate.
- **macOS** — a Developer ID Application certificate plus an Apple notarization profile;
  the flow is `codesign` → `notarytool submit` → `stapler`.
- **Linux** — a GPG key for package/repository signing.

CI packages are `UNSIGNED` because these credentials are not present in CI. Do not treat any
current artifact as signed. See the verification report and
packaging and signing for exactly what is proven,
and implementation status for the Phase-7 gate list.

## Publish the framework and npm packages

Distributing your *app* is the installer above. If you are also publishing JDesk itself or
its JS packages, the flows are:

```bash
# Framework artifacts — local verification, no credentials:
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

# Real publish (credentials supplied at invocation, never checked in):
./gradlew publish \
  -PjdeskPublishUrl=https://maven.pkg.github.com/tuanworlddev/jdesk \
  -PjdeskPublishUser=<user> -PjdeskPublishToken=<token>

# The two npm packages:
npm --prefix js/create-jdesk-app publish --access public   # the scaffolder
npm --prefix js/jdesk-client publish --access public       # jdesk-client runtime
```

A signed Maven release adds an in-memory PGP key (`-PsigningKey=... -PsigningPassword=...`).
Publishing to a public repository requires repository credentials and an npm token that
only the account owner can supply. See
scaffolding and publishing for the full
publish → consume chain.
